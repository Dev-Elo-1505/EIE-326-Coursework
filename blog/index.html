          We live in an age of conflict. Wars in far away lands, wars with our
          neighbours, and now more than ever, we’re at war with the digital
          world. Our attention spans are dying before our eyes, with our
          discernment and critical thinking hanging on by a thread. Ever since
          the rise of ‘Fake News’, Trump’s first term as president, and the
          Covid pandemic, there’s a feeling that society as a collective is
          getting dumber. Yes, it sounds harsh and perhaps it is. But maybe this
          is the wake up call we so needed.

          ‘Brain rot’ was the 2024 word of the year as announced by the Oxford
          English Dictionary. It is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a
          person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result
          of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content)
          considered to be trivial or unchallenging”. The rise in short-form
          media from platforms like Instagram and TikTok have made it so easy
          for users to waste away doomscrolling their perfectly curated
          algorithms. The content we tend to consume is engaging to the eye but
          not to the brain. It lacks substance. While social media has some
          positive, redeeming attributes, it has largely taken over our lives
          and, most importantly, our free time. We read less, we do less
          hobbies, we learn less. And when we take up a hobby, social media
          urges you to monetise it. Because if it doesn’t feed the capitalist
          beast, why should I care for it, right?

          While this essay primarily discusses anti-intellectualism and the
          decline of humanities degrees in the US and the UK, these issues
          affect the entire world. The more we depend on social media dopamine
          hits and AI, the less equipped we are as a society to resist those who
          seek to undermine our democracies, distort our belief systems and
          accumulate wealth at our expense. If you’ve read this far, you are
          likely a curious mind with a genuine thirst for knowledge. Someone who
          has begun to recognise the pitfalls of digital overconsumption,
          extreme political narratives and the dark side of assigning value to
          subjects solely through a capitalist lens. Reclaiming your brain
          through self-education and personal research is how we move forward!
